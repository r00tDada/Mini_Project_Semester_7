WORK EXPERIENCE
SAMSUNG RESEARCH INSTITUTE BANGALORE | Student Trainee






Remote, ON | Jun 2021  present
I am working on the Proof Of Concept of Service Enabler Layer for 5G Verticals (SEAL).
SEAL is an interface between 3rd parties like Vertical Application Layer (VAL) and various cellular networks
including 5G Core Network.
I am tasked with implementing the SEAL server (SEAL-s) for the location management APIs as per 3GPP standards.
This task also involves implementing the Network Exposure Functions (NEF) simulator. NEFs duty is to expose the
3GPP Core Network capabilities for the consumption by 3rd parties.
Both NEF-Sim and SEAL-s are being implemented in GO language with the MongoDB and MySQL databases
respectively.

PROJECTS
Python, MongoDB, Graph API, Keras, ANN
This project was a group project. It involved scraping data from an educational Facebook group run by IIM-A, using
Facebooks Graph API, then preprocessing of data like converting image data to feature vectors using VGG16 and
extracting sentiment values from comments using NLTK.
This data is then used to visualise the group activity. A multi-modal(visual and text) Neural Network was then built using
Keras for the prediction of reaction-counts of the posts.
Here I contributed to the whole project except for extracting the sentiment values and visualisation part.

ANALYSIS OF FACEBOOK GROUP DATA 

Java, Android Studio
Its an Android APP built to help music enthusiasts to learn how to play some basic piano tunes using the on-screen
piano, it also allows users to share their own tune to other users.

Linear Regression(Predicting HousePrice )
(06/2020 - 07/2020)
In this project , Linear regression is used to predict a continuous
value (house prices) from features of the house (square feet of living
space, number of bedrooms,...).
Cost estimation is done by using the residual sum of squares.This
means that given a regression line through the data we calculate the
distance from each data point to the regression line, square it, and
sum all of the squared errors together
library used : pandas , numpy , sklearn

ACADEMIC PROJECTS
Reduction of Training Dataset
This project developed in 6th Semester as Mini Project. We used hybrid SOM-KMeans clustering to reduce
samples. At first, we reduce the outliers via the SOM Clustering, then we further reduced the sample by using
homogeneous K-Means clustering. We had implemented on four datasets and achieved an average of 90%
reduction.
Dimensionality Reduction in HSI
This project developed in 5th Semester as Mini Project. We used genetic algorithm to reduce the dimensions
and further classified by SVM. We tested the algorithm on aviris and cloudless hyperion datsets, having
accuracy of 73% and 92% respectively.
Dijkstra Visualization
This project was developed in 3rd Semester in OOM Course. Developed an interface where the user can add
vertex and draw edges with the help of mouse among the vertex making a weighted graph. Then the interface
will visualize the shortest path between the pair of vertices by making the path coloured and an animated
shape to move along the path.

SKILLS
This is a topic that perhaps I cannot just cover in one page. You name some tech stack, I have
seen it, worked with it. If I havent , no worries, I learn it quickly. I have been a competitive
programmer. I have been asked what difference it makes , what impact it has and being a
philosopher I answer what difference does it make if it is rewarding for someone else or not, it
is a higher good for me, thats why I do it. But still coming to a technical answer, ask yourself if a
single day passes when you have not seen some sort of algorithm in your daily life, you get the
answer. Same is with machine learning, I like to keep myself updated with trends. A fast growing
field and definitely a lot to learn and apply.

EXPERIENCE/ PROJECTS
SUMMER ANALYST, CITIBANK - INDIA - learning new stuff
June-July 2021



Learning how to deal with the corporate world, make new friends, learning new stuff and
implementing it.
Here I am working with big data tools, in layman terms I am working on building an
efficient data management system.

CIR, IIIT-ALLAHABAD - Semester 6 - Welcome to Robotics
Jan-June 2021





Guess one of the best experiences at IIIT-A. I got selected for building up a module that
picks and places an object using the latest technologies.
I wrote a monthly report , which is hard to explain here, but feel free to ask or query any
doubts you have about it.
Essentially it involves reinforcement learning, object detection using Yolo, Alexnet, RNN
and deep pose estimation. They are long concepts but definitely worth your time.

CHEAT SHEET, IIIT-ALLAHABAD - Semester 4,5,6 - Online Exams at Home
March 2020 - May 2021







There are some exams . Perhaps you can cheat in online mode, but our professors are
intelligent. They gave us tough exams involving computations. Cheating does not make
any sense. One wrong calculation can get propagated. So I applied coding to many of
the standard questions. So I give input from the exam to them and they solve and print
the answer. Cheating ? No, Since I coded it myself.
DATA MINING, consider this, just change the question name in main, give input to it and
it prints the output to many standard questions.
This is a code I am pretty proud of. My professor gave it to me to code in five days. I did it
in like one Day, an interesting story, even what code does, this, gets the minimal canonical
form. Check detailed explanation in minimal canonical form .
Created an artificial intelligence based checkers game.

MINI PROJECT , IIIT-ALLAHABAD - Semester 5 - Image to caption generator.
July-Nov 2020




Give an image to the model, it gives you a caption, pretty standard, nothing fancy.
But helpful in learning concepts like, CNN, GRU, and many more tech stack like google
colab and so on.
Mostly it involved going through theoretical concepts and recent advancements in the
field.

RESEARCH INTERN, IIIT-ALLAHABAD - Password Intrusion Detection
May-July 2020




I completed this under guidance of Dr. Soumyadev Maity (His_Profile).
Under this I learnt the basics of anomaly detection.
I applied various algorithms to detect intrusion primarily implemented in C++.





The goal of this project was to develop a system which can detect password intrusion
with the help of typing patterns of the user.
The equal error-rates of 9.30% were reached during this.
More details of my work can be found at my_work_on_password_intrusion.

SOCIAL VAIDYA, IIIT-ALLAHABAD -Web Developer
January-February 2020






Helped in developing a new website which will lead to increase in both professional and
customers, making it more user friendly by adding the new functionalities like an online
chat box where customers can interact with the clinic before getting there.
Used Emerging Technologies which helped in decreasing the response time of the
website by almost 40% thereby making it more user friendly.
Helped in writing health related content for my company on Facebook which increased
the number of followers on facebook page by 100%.
You can check the online chat box created by me at my_app.

on user input graph.

Game of Checkers using AI
Java FX, Scene Builder, Artificial Intelligence
 The game was developed in 3 modes i.e human vs human, human vs

computer and computer vs computer.

 It was built on the concept of Min- Max Algorithm and alpha beta

pruning of AI

3D Transformation of Cube
Java FX, Scene Builder
 In this a 2D cube appears on the screen.When we drag the mouse the

cube performs rotations in the direction in which the mouse was
dragged.

 It can also develop the required 3D model in either wireframe or as

solid shape and even change the colour of the cube.The speed of
rotation can also be controlled.We can see the linear motion as well as
the 3D motion of the cube
